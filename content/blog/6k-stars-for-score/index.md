We are extremely proud of how much Score has taken off and resonated with developers. The next step is to create more opportunities for the community to contribute.

On January 18, our product manager [Susa Tuenker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susatuenker/) will be speaking at the [CNCF TAG App Delivery meetup](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery#meetings). In the meantime, we look forward to scouting and submitting talks to more events to spread the word about Score’s functionality and application.

Keep an eye out on our blog and [socials](https://www.linkedin.com/company/score-dev/) to get updates on upcoming events. We’d love to see you there! 

Thank you so much for your continued support and contribution – Score would not be possible without your involvement and your questions! 

Happy new year by the Score Team! Keep up with us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/scorecommunity/shared_invite/zt-1i2glkqkl-EnjSWSCgYUyaEGwmDYBZZQ), [GitHub](https://github.com/score-spec/spec/discussions) and on [our socials](https://www.linkedin.com/company/score-dev/).
