Score just received its 500th star on GitHub!

We are ecstatic that so many eyes are on our project so early on. This indicates that the community is invested in our journey. We couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve accomplished so far and of what is to come!

Score is still a work in progress. We are excited for the work we will be doing in the next months and years to come.

If you want to join the Score community, join the [#score channel on the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io).

Thanks again, and see you really soon!
