We’re very excited to announce that [Score](https://github.com/score-spec/spec), an open-source workload specification, has been accepted as a Sandbox project by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as of July 8, 2024.

Before anything else, we want to give a huge shoutout to everyone who has been supporting the Score project on its journey. This includes the incredible Score community who has been by our side with continuous contributions and feedback—without you, Score wouldn’t be where it is today.

A big thank you to everyone from the CNCF involved in the process, especially the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) [members](https://www.cncf.io/people/technical-oversight-committee/) for guiding us in the right direction and the [TAG App Delivery team](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/) for allowing us to [present and discuss Score with the CNCF community](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/79#issuecomment-1969011565).

Check [our submission](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/79) for full details on the process.

Being accepted into the CNCF sandbox is a major milestone for Score, and the timing couldn’t be better! We recently rolled out [two new reference implementations for Docker Compose and Kubernetes](https://score.dev/blog/a-new-chapter-for-score-introducing-our-reference-implementations-for-compose-k8s), offering a user-friendly and scalable solution to get started with the Score spec. This momentum provides a great baseline for us to engage with the CNCF community and further drive the development and adoption of Score.

As we look ahead, we’re excited about the impact we can make in the community. Score’s developer-centric and [workload-oriented approach](https://score.dev/blog/workload-centric-over-infrastructure-centric-development) to cloud-native development positions us to contribute to ongoing discussions about platform engineering best practices and industry standards. We’re eager to explore questions like: What is the right level of abstraction for developers? How can we effectively separate concerns between developers and platform engineers? What role does a workload specification play in this context?

The potential to integrate and collaborate with other platforms and tools within the CNCF landscape is something we’re particularly thrilled about - it means empowering teams to quickly test and adopt new tools without overwhelming developers with added cognitive load.

If we’ve sparked your interest and you’d be curious about working on an implementation for Score, don’t hesitate to reach out - we’d love to make this a reality! We welcome contributors from both new organisations and individual contributors.
