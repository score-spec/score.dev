We are excited to announce we will be guests of the Platform Engineering Meetups series to talk about Score.

On December 13, at 7 PM CET, two Score's main contributors and maintainers, Susa Tuenker and SÃ¶ren Martius, will be talking about how Score's goal to put the developer experience at the center is trying to solve local and cloud sync challenges and the difficulty of using different tech stacks in different environments. 

The conversation will last around 30 minutes and there will be space for community questions and feedback. 

Thank you to the Platform Engineering community for hosting this discussion.
